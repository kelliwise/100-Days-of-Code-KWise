# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### My 2019 attempt at completing a full 100 days of code.

I'll be doing a lot of coding privately while I'm working on projects, so you'll see that there have been commits. You just won't see those commits. I'll post anything public that I can here or on CodePen.

### Day 1: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I'm working my way through the Know the Code GIT labs. Completed all of my local development setup and watched the first few videos.

Thoughts: I really should use GIT more often. It is incredibly handy when you're doing lots of code. I make loads of mistakes, so being able to back out of those mistakes is really fabulous.

### Day 2: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first the Know the Code GIT lab.
