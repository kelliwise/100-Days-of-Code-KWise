# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### My 2019 attempt at completing a full 100 days of code.

I'll be doing a lot of coding privately while I'm working on projects, so you'll see that there have been commits. You just won't see those commits. I'll post anything public that I can here or on CodePen.

### Day 1: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I'm working my way through the Know the Code GIT labs. Completed all of my local development setup and watched the first few videos.

Thoughts: I really should use GIT more often. It is incredibly handy when you're doing lots of code. I make loads of mistakes, so being able to back out of those mistakes is really fabulous.

### Day 2: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first the Know the Code GIT lab. 

Thoughts: Her instruction is very complete if not a bit repetitive at times. It could also be that I know GIT, just not as deeply as I would like to.

### Day 3: August 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Plan: Complete the second the Know the Code GIT lab.

Thoughts: I did not complete the 2nd GIT lab. This lab is on team contributions. Fork, Clone, Merge and more. Each lab is about 3 hours of videos. Add in the time I'm practicing and each lab is about half a day's work.

### Day 4: August 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed 9 videos in the second the Know the Code GIT lab.

Thoughts: It's a weekend and a smaller goal would be more likely to get completed. Finished all the videos on branch workflow. 

### Day 5: August 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Plan: Completed 6 videos in the second the Know the Code GIT lab.

Thoughts: It's a weekend and a smaller goal would be more likely to get completed. Try to finish the pull and push request videos. Wrap up the GIT lab on Monday.
