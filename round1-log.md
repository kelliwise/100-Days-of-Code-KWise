# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### My second attempt at completing a full 100 days of code.

I'll be doing a lot of coding privately while I'm working on a client project, so you'll see that there have been commits. You just won't see those commits. I'll post anything public that I can here or on CodePen.

### Day 1: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I reviewed the course on using GIT. I've done the course before, but I forgot some of it, so I re-watched it. That done, I created a new repo for a custom theme, created a new branch to work on a page template, and did some work on the page template and functions.php file. BTW, I mostly work in WordPress, so there's that.

Thoughts: I really should use GIT more often. It is incredibly handy when you're doing lots of code. I make loads of mistakes, so being able to back out of those mistakes is really fabulous.

### Day 2: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on some CSS, particularly making home page widget elements in a grid layout. Learned today: overlapping grid cells. also played with using flexbox for navigation items. Learned today: where grid and flex are best used.

Thoughts: Jen Simmons, Rachel Andrews and Chris Coyier are my go-to experts for all things CSS.

Today's Plan: finalize the home page layout and grid css.

**Today's Progress:** customizing the customizer functions for the home page.

### Day 8: May 1, 2018

Today's Plan: Finish home page widgets, footer widgets, and site-header area except menu

**Today's progress:** learned how to set logo height/width and proportion. Also how to use php to change css when logo size is greater than a fixed amount. 

// Place menu below logo and center logo once it gets big.
	$css .= ( has_custom_logo() && ( 200 <= $logo_max_width ) ) ?
	
Created a custom search form for my theme. Replaced "Search" with an icon. This is done with code in the functions file and with css. 

Added a widget area below the main nav for the search form and custom navigation.

Today's Plan: Start a them using underscores

**Today's progress:** Added footer widget areas assigning css class dynamically. Removed background and header images from the customizer. 

Added the social media widget area but it's not inheriting the plugin's styling. Or maybe it's the plugin. Who knows.

### Day 11: May 8, 2018
