# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Kelli Wise

### My second attempt at completing a full 100 days of code.

I'll be doing a lot of coding privately while I'm working on a client project, so you'll see that there have been commits. You just won't see those commits. I'll post anything public that I can here or on CodePen.

### Day 1: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I reviewed the course on using GIT. I've done the course before, but I forgot some of it, so I re-watched it. That done, I created a new repo for a custom theme, created a new branch to work on a page template, and did some work on the page template and functions.php file. BTW, I mostly work in WordPress, so there's that.

Thoughts: I really should use GIT more often. It is incredibly handy when you're doing lots of code. I make loads of mistakes, so being able to back out of those mistakes is really fabulous.

### Day 2: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on some CSS, particularly making home page widget elements in a grid layout. Learned today: overlapping grid cells. also played with using flexbox for navigation items. Learned today: where grid and flex are best used.

Thoughts: Jen Simmons, Rachel Andrews and Chris Coyier are my go-to experts for all things CSS.

Today's Plan: finalize the home page layout and grid css.
